# What?

[Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com)

> This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.

# Why?

Learn about crypto concepts while practicing [Go](https://golang.org/).
